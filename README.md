Rizki Calame && Hidde Statema - Project 3
=========

This repository is made for the third project of our minor Mobile Interaction.


========= Optimalisation =========

Since we're writing the software in Objective-C, our terms of optimalisation will be different than when we're writing software in another language, such as Javascript. We'll be focussing on preventing memory leaks and unnecessary object creation. Other than that - we'll be trying to write 'good and fast' code.
